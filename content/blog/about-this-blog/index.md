## Hi, hello!

Craft AND Code, huh? 

> tl;dr Front end web developer sharing their journey through ongoing learning, crafty projects, and whatever else!

--------------

### **The code part** 

Currently, I am ongoing learning and working on web development projects for practice for a fulltime fullstack role. My first language was diving into JavaScript, some front end, and now adding in some Python.

This blog initially was covering the course [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/) - Intro to Computer Science, but fell off that wagon last summer. They have a completely new course for [Python specifically](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/). Code updates here will be reflecting on the problem sets and what I have learned so far.

But _why_...

My current career goal and adjustment is to be hired as a web developer/software engineer (the titles are sometimes vague so I used both), where I've gone through a few free learning platforms (freeCodeCamp, Codecademy, The Odin Project, etc), I have had my eye on the CS50 group of courses for quite some time now.

### **The crafty part**
When I'm not coding, I like to create and crafting other things! To keep my fidgety hands still, I like to knit, sew, and cross stitch. These updates will probably be a bit more spare but, but I want to share coders can have creative hobbies too :)

Feel free to reach out on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/haley_elder), or from another one of my socials from my [website](https://haleyelder.com) to chat obout either.
