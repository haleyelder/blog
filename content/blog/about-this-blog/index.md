## Hi, hello!

Craft AND Code, huh? 

> tl;dr Front end web developer sharing their journey through an intro to computer science course and some crafty projects updates. 

--------------

### **The code part** 

Currently, I practice web development in my free time with a focus on front end with a little taste of fullstack JavaScript projects, I also want to expand into more Python programming.

I've attempted this free course, [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/) - Intro to Computer Science, offered by Harvard through Edx at least twice now, so third time getting through might be the charm. The code portion will be reflecting and documenting my review of wokring through the problems and projects.

But _why_...

My current career goal is to be hired as a web developer/software engineer (the titles are sometimes vague so I used both), where I've gone through a few free learning platforms (freeCodeCamp, Codecademy, The Odin Project, etc), I wanted to explore some more computer science fundamentals i.e. what it could have looked like if I went back to school for this. 

CS50 starts with C programming and CS basics, then into JavaScript and Python with a web extension that matches my current career track aspirations. The course is structured into 10 weeks for the intro "base" portion and a specific 8 week web track I will be continuing after the first is done. 


### **The crafty part**
When I'm not coding, I like to create and crafting other things! To keep my fidgety hands still, I like to knit, sew, and cross stitch. These updates will probably be a bit more spare but, but I want to share coders can have creative hobbies too :)

Feel free to reach out on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/haley_elder), or from another one of my socials from my [website](https://haleyelder.com) to chat obout either.
