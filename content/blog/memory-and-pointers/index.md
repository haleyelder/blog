this is the first possible worrisome week cuz i had heard pointers were confusing and no idea anything about memory but have heard a lot about it as well. once going through the lecture, the heap and stack made a lot more sense and some stuff i hear at work again and how 'overflows' work

pinters point to a location in memory (dart board location) referring to specific values. the address

luckily nice that the browser ide is just browser or else can crash computer with memory leaks. heap and stack overflow makes more sense now. create that memory and then release it or else it will go over and bad things happen! aka crash computer etcc

compare, copoying and swapping was a common theme, and creating that extra memory was. lots of swapping with the filter problem set, you had to create lots of copies of the pixel





- super delayed due to new kitto! It’s been about a month since I got him and he’s pretty good most times but def some trial and error how to deal with kitten energy and tendencies! His cuddles make up for the early day wakings though, incredibly loud purr machine!
- like most would say, most difficult week so far… going through lecture most made sense in theory but in practice.. oof
– recover was slighlty easier..
– filter was insanely difficult; in practice, theory and everything;

- I realized I def have ben doing better with the ‘you write all of the program yourself’ than jumpin in what’s already there which is slighlyt worrisome but ive done that before.. on tiny scale and I think it’s partly due to being C and the ins and outs of the language that gets glazed over and sure gotta dig but ugh

- slwoly working through using typed definition as char *s instead of string since it's part of the cs50 library. also scanf for get_string type of command 

week 4 memory!
