description: I've been stitching in some form for many years, but never an embroidery kit. Time to fix that.

testing deploy- will revert

I've completed quite a few stitch projects knitting, crocheting, sewing, and other crafts in the past, but have yet had a chance to try out embroidery. A few weeks ago I went to a local maker fair to see if there was anything that may pique my interest, and found an embroidery kit from a [local artist](https://www.etceteraembroidery.com/) featuring some waves in the sunset and under the moon to try out. The additional perk of this maker fair was around 5-10% of the purchase price went to local charities; stitch for good right?

For 99.9% of the time I was stitching these two little hoops, I was parked in front of the TV watching any and all Olympics recaps I could fit in one day. It was partially background sound but also seeing incredible competition and new sports debut (surfing, climbing, and skateboarding to name a few). I know not many were thrilled the games were still going this year even postponed one year, for the ones that could attend, I loved to see the excitement the athletes got for winning medals, or even being present at the games is a huge feat. 

On with the pictures!

Cross stitching and embroidery will most likely be my new summer stitch hobby for when it's too hot to knit and break it up a little bit. The finishing touches were quite quick and easy and I knew exactly where to put them; in my work-from-home office area (hence the border of corkboard there...). The center is a cross stitch I finished this spring of my favorite flower, peonies.

They're not perfect, and that's the point :)

Till next time!
